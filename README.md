Alright, this is an excellent idea! A `README.md` file will make it easy to follow along.

I will structure the plan as a Markdown file, including:

* **Overall Goal and Strategy**
* **Daily Time Commitment Reminder**
* **A "Table of Contents" based on LearnYard's sections.**
* **Detailed Daily Plan:** For each day, I'll list:
    * The **date** (starting from Monday, June 17, 2024, given today's date).
    * The **LearnYard section(s)** to focus on.
    * **Specific problems** to attempt from that section (I will list common problem types or specific problems if LearnYard clearly presents them in a sequential manner, otherwise, I'll recommend picking from their list).
    * **Key concepts/tasks** for that day (e.g., "Read theory," "Implement basic operations").

**Important Considerations for Problem Listing:**

* The LearnYard link you provided is a general practice page, and it doesn't dynamically show a fixed, ordered list of *all* problems for each section in an easily scrapable format.
* Therefore, for the daily plan, I will suggest **types of problems or well-known problems** that align with each section. **You will need to navigate to the respective section on LearnYard and pick problems that match the description and difficulty level (starting with Easy).**
* As you progress, the number of problems per day will vary. In the beginning, it's more about understanding; later, it's about solving.

Let's generate that `README.md` for your 200-day DSA journey!

# üöÄ 200-Day DSA Learning Plan with LearnYard üöÄ

This comprehensive plan is designed for a beginner in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) aiming to complete the LearnYard practice questions within 200 days, dedicating 3-5 hours daily (primarily weekdays). The focus is on building a strong foundation, understanding concepts thoroughly, and tackling problems progressively by difficulty.

**Start Date:** Monday, June 17, 2024
**End Date (Approx.):** Sunday, January 05, 2025

## üéØ Overall Goal & Strategy

* **Foundation First:** Prioritize understanding core concepts before jumping into complex problems.
* **Gradual Difficulty:** Start with Easy problems, then slowly transition to Medium as confidence grows. Hard problems are stretch goals for later stages.
* **Consistency is Key:** Dedicate your committed hours daily. Even short, focused sessions are better than sporadic long ones.
* **Active Learning:** Don't just read solutions. Try to articulate the thought process, trace examples, and implement solutions yourself.
* **Patience:** DSA is challenging. Embrace frustration as part of the learning process. You will get stuck, and that's okay!
* **LearnYard as Your Guide:** Leverage the articles and problem sets on [LearnYard DSA Practice](https://learnyard.com/practice/dsa) for theory and problems.

## ‚è∞ Daily Time Commitment

* **Weekdays:** Aim for **4 hours daily**, with flexibility for **3-5 hours**.
    * **1.5 - 2 hours:** Concept study, reading LearnYard articles, reviewing notes.
    * **1.5 - 2.5 hours:** Problem-solving (1-2 easy problems, or deep dive into 1 medium problem, including understanding the solution if stuck).
* **Weekends:** Use weekends for deeper dives into challenging topics, reviewing weekly progress, catching up on missed problems, or taking a well-deserved break to avoid burnout.

    * **Focus:** Comprehensive review of all data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Maps, Trees, Graphs).
    * **Tasks:** Go through your notes, revisit key concepts, and ensure you can explain them clearly.
    * **Problems:** Solve 2-3 mixed easy/medium problems from different categories daily.
* **Day 106-110 (Mon, Nov 11 - Fri, Nov 15, 2024):**
    * **Focus:** Comprehensive review of all algorithms (Sorting, Searching, Two Pointers, Recursion, Backtracking, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, BFS/DFS).
    * **Tasks:** Understand the trade-offs between different algorithms.
    * **Problems:** Solve 2-3 mixed easy/medium problems, focusing on identifying the correct algorithm.
* **Day 111-115 (Mon, Nov 18 - Fri, Nov 22, 2024):**
    * **LearnYard Section:** Number Theory (Optional, if time permits and interested)
    * **Concepts:** Prime numbers, GCD, LCM, Sieve of Eratosthenes.
    * **Problems (Choose 1-2 Easy/Medium):** Implement Sieve, find prime factors.
* **Day 116-120 (Mon, Nov 25 - Fri, Nov 29, 2024):**
    * **LearnYard Section:** String Algorithms (Optional, if time permits and interested)
    * **Concepts:** KMP Algorithm (conceptual if too complex), Rabin-Karp, string matching.
    * **Problems (Choose 1 Medium):** Simple string matching or manipulation problems.
* **Day 121-125 (Mon, Dec 02 - Fri, Dec 06, 2024):**
    * **LearnYard Section:** Bonus Topics (Optional, advanced - Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees, Sparse Tables)
    * **Concepts:** Read basic intuition for these topics. Do *not* stress about implementing them unless you have ample time and confidence. These are typically for competitive programming.
    * **Problems:** Focus on understanding problem types these structures solve.
* **Day 126-130 (Mon, Dec 09 - Fri, Dec 13, 2024):**
    * **Focus:** Solving a mix of medium problems from all topics.
    * **Strategy:** Try to solve problems under timed conditions (e.g., 45-60 mins per problem).
* **Day 131-135 (Mon, Dec 16 - Fri, Dec 20, 2024):**
    * **Focus:** Identifying and practicing common interview patterns.
    * **Strategy:** Look for "top interview questions" lists online and try to solve them using your learned techniques.
* **Day 136-140 (Mon, Dec 23 - Fri, Dec 27, 2024):**
    * **Focus:** Mock Interviews.
    * **Strategy:** Practice explaining your thought process, approach, and code. Do mock interviews with peers or on platforms like Pramp/Exponent.
* **Day 141-145 (Mon, Dec 30 - Fri, Jan 03, 2025):**
    * **Focus:** Final brush-up, revisit hard topics.
    * **Strategy:** Relax, consolidate, and trust your preparation.

## ‚úÖ How to Use This Plan Effectively

1.  **Navigate LearnYard:** For each day, go to the specified section on [LearnYard DSA Practice](https://learnyard.com/practice/dsa).
2.  **Read Theory First:** Always start by thoroughly reading the conceptual articles related to the day's topic.
3.  **Implement Basics:** For data structures, try to implement their core functionalities from scratch (e.g., linked list node, stack push/pop) before jumping to complex problems.
4.  **Pick Problems:** Select problems from LearnYard's list that match the suggested difficulty (Easy, then Medium) and the current topic. If a specific problem isn't explicitly named, choose one that fits the description.
5.  **Stuck? Analyze:** If you're stuck for more than 30-45 minutes, look at the solution *concept*, understand it, and then try to implement it yourself without looking at the code.
6.  **Review Solutions:** Always review optimal solutions, even if you solved the problem. Look for alternative approaches or more efficient ways.
7.  **Take Notes:** Keep a separate notebook or digital document to jot down key concepts, problem-solving patterns, and areas you struggled with.
8.  **Stay Hydrated & Take Breaks:** Essential for effective learning!

This plan is a guideline. Feel free to adjust the pace based on your learning speed. The most important thing is to understand each concept deeply before moving on. Good luck on your DSA journey! You've got this!
